# Security Policy

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Input Validation & Sanitization
- Email validation with regex patterns
- String sanitization to prevent XSS attacks
- Input length limits and type checking
- Tutor ID validation against whitelist

### 2. Security Headers
- Content Security Policy (CSP)
- X-Frame-Options: DENY
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
- X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
- Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin
- HSTS in production

### 3. TypeScript Configuration
- Strict mode enabled
- Strict null checks
- Force consistent casing in file names
- No implicit any types

### 4. Error Handling
- Global ErrorBoundary component
- Secure logging with sensitive data redaction
- Proper error messages without information leakage

### 5. Storage Security
- Safe localStorage operations with error handling
- Server-side rendering compatibility
- Input validation before storage

### 6. Dependencies
- Regular security audits with `npm audit`
- ESLint security plugin
- Up-to-date dependencies
